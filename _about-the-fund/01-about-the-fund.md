### 1. About the Fund
####   Overview
The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the &quot;Fund&quot;) was set up on 28 November, 2011, at the
launch of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s new book, “My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore’s Bilingual Journey”.
The Fund is set up as a company limited by guarantee, with Charity and Institution of a Public
Character status.

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning English and the Mother
Tongue Languages helps prepare our children to plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to
our Asian heritage.

The Fund has been set up to supplement efforts by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the teaching
and learning of English and the Mother Tongue Languages.

####   What the Fund Does
Our MTL, heritage and culture forms an integral part of Singapore&#39;s identity and asset. The Fund
supports proposals that encourage bilingualism and the learning of our MTLs as  living languages
and a lifelong endeavour.

####   Our Structure
The Fund is managed by a Board and supported by the following committees: 
(i) Project Evaluation Committee (PEC)

(ii) Publicity and Outreach Committee (POC)

(iii) Investment Advisory Committee (IAC) 

(iv) Audit Committee (AC)

(v) Research Advisory Panel
