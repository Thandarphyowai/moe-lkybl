  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism<br/> Whistle Blowing Policy & Procedures </h2>
  <h3  style= "text-decoration: underline;">Policy</h3>
  <p>1.    This   policy   addresses   the   commitment   of   the   Lee Kuan   Yew   Fund  for Bilingualism  (“the  Fund”)  to  integrity  and  ethical behavior  by  helping  to  foster  and maintain an environment where all its stakeholders can act appropriately, without fear of retaliation.  To  maintain  these  standards,  the  Fund encourages  its  stakeholders  who have concerns about suspected serious misconduct or any breach or suspected breach of law or regulation that may adversely impact the Fund, to come forward and express these concerns without fear of punishment or unfair treatment.</p>
<p>2.     The  Fund  runs  its  operations  based  on  the  principles  of  fairness,  honesty, openness,  decency,  integrity  and  respect.  It  is  the  Fund’s  policy  to  support  and encourage  its  stakeholders  to  report  and  disclose  improper  or  illegal  activities,  and  to fully investigate such reports and disclosures. It is also the Fund’s policy to address any complaints  that  allege  acts  or  attempted  acts  of  interference,  reprisal,  retaliation, threats, coercion or intimidation against stakeholders who report, disclose or investigate improper  or  illegal  activities  (the  “Whistleblowers”)  and  to  protect  those  who  come forward to report such activities. The Fund assures that all reports will be treated strictly confidentially  and  promptly  investigated  and  that  reports  can  be made anonymously,  if desired. </p>
<p>3.    The Fund’s internal control and operating procedures are intended to detect and to  prevent  or  deter  improper  activities.  However,  even  the  best  systems  of  controls cannot   provide   absolute   safeguards   against   irregularities.   The   Fund   has   the responsibility  to  investigate  and  report  to  appropriate  parties,  allegations  of  suspected improper activities and to take appropriate actions. Stakeholders are encouraged to use guidance provided by this policy for reporting all allegations of suspected misconduct or improper activities.  </p>
               <h2 style= "text-decoration: underline;">Objective and Scope of Policy </h2>
<p>4. The Whistle Blowing Policy (“the Code”) is intended to: 
  <li>To  provide  avenues  for  stakeholders  to  raise  concerns  and  define  a  way  to handle these concerns. </li>
  <li>To enable the Board of Directors to be informed at an early stage about acts of misconduct.  </li>
  <li>To  reassure  stakeholders  that  they  will  be  protected  from  punishment  or unfair treatment for disclosing concerns in good faith in accordance with this procedure.  </li>
  <li>To help develop a culture of openness, accountability and integrity.  </li>
  <li>To  encourage  stakeholders  to  feel  confident  in  raising  serious       concerns  and to question and act upon their concerns.  </li>
  <li>To ensure that stakeholders get a response to their concerns.  </li>
  <li>To  reassure  stakeholders  that  if  they  raise  any  concerns  in  good  faith  and reasonably  believe  them  to  be  true,  they  will  be  protected  from  possible reprisals or victimization, to the extent where the situation allows </li></p>
